# Domestic-Commerical-Waste-Classification
The garbage classification is a social issue related to peopleâ€™s livelihood and  sustainable development, so letting service robots autonomously perform  intelligent garbage classification has important research significance. In this  project we proposed an artificial intelligence-based machine learning algorithm to  classify commercial and domestic waste in an efficient way to resolve this serious  issue. In order to build this algorithm, we used Py-torch which is an open-source  machine learning framework based on Python, we also used convolutional neural  network-based architecture Resnet50 model pretrained on ImageNet dataset.  Finally, we tested the model with random images and achieve the remarkable  results having the actual accuracy of 95% on the testing images and 60% accuracy  on the external images.
